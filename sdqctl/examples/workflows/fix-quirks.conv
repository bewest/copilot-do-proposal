# fix-quirks.conv - Iterate through quirks with research/implement phases
#
# An optimized workflow for addressing known quirks one at a time.
# Designed to minimize context usage while maintaining focus.
#
# Usage:
#   sdqctl cycle examples/workflows/fix-quirks.conv --adapter copilot -n 3
#
# Design principles (following QUIRKS.md guidance):
# 1. Implementation-oriented filename (fix-, not track-)
# 2. Minimal context injection - agent reads files on demand
# 3. Explicit role clarification in PROLOGUE
# 4. Single quirk focus per session
# 5. Research blockers handled before implementation

# === Role Clarification ===
# Explicit implementation intent to override any filename inference
PROLOGUE You are an implementation assistant. Your job is to EDIT FILES directly.
PROLOGUE Do not describe changes - make them using edit tools.
PROLOGUE When blocked by missing information, document the blocker and stop.

# === Minimal Session Context ===
PROLOGUE ---
PROLOGUE Session: {{DATETIME}} | Branch: {{GIT_BRANCH}}
PROLOGUE ---

# === Implementation Reminders ===
EPILOGUE ---
EPILOGUE Remember:
EPILOGUE - ONE quirk per session (do not batch)
EPILOGUE - Research blockers → document and stop
EPILOGUE - Implementation ready → edit files directly
EPILOGUE - Test changes before marking complete

# === Cycle 1: Select and Assess ===
PROMPT ## Quirk Selection

Review the quirks backlog at `docs/QUIRKS.md`.

**Task:** Select ONE quirk to work on this session.

Selection criteria:
1. P0 quirks before P1/P2
2. Quirks with clear "Future Fix Options" 
3. Quirks where implementation is unblocked

**Output format:**
```
### Selected: Q-XXX
**Title:** [from QUIRKS.md]
**Priority:** P0/P1/P2
**Status:** Research needed | Ready to implement
**Blocker (if any):** [what's missing]
**Approach:** [which fix option, or research needed]
```

If the quirk needs research first, state what information is missing.
If ready to implement, state which fix option you'll use.

# === Cycle 2: Research or Implement ===
PROMPT ## Execute

Based on your assessment:

**If research needed:**
1. Investigate the codebase to gather missing information
2. Document findings in a new section of `docs/QUIRKS.md` under the quirk
3. Update the quirk's status with research results
4. If now unblocked, proceed to implementation

**If ready to implement:**
1. Implement the fix using the approach you identified
2. Make minimal, surgical changes
3. Add or update tests if the fix is testable
4. Run `pytest tests/ -v --tb=short` to verify

**Do NOT just describe changes. Edit files directly.**

# === Cycle 3: Verify and Document ===
PROMPT ## Completion

Summarize the work and update tracking.

**If implementation completed:**
1. Update `docs/QUIRKS.md`:
   - Change quirk status to "Fixed" or "Mitigated"
   - Add implementation notes
2. List files modified
3. Confirm tests pass

**If blocked:**
1. Update `docs/QUIRKS.md` with:
   - What was learned
   - What's still missing
   - Suggested next steps
2. Do NOT attempt workarounds - document and stop

**Output:**
```
### Session Result: Q-XXX
**Outcome:** Completed | Blocked | Partial
**Files changed:** [list]
**Tests:** Pass | Fail | N/A
**Next action:** [if blocked, what's needed]
```

# === Output Configuration ===
OUTPUT-FORMAT markdown

# === Notes ===
# This workflow intentionally:
# - Does NOT inject docs/QUIRKS.md as CONTEXT (agent reads on demand)
# - Does NOT use {{WORKFLOW_NAME}} in prompts (avoids Q-001)
# - Uses explicit implementation language in PROLOGUE
# - Limits to 3 cycles for focus (select → execute → verify)
# - Stops on blockers rather than working around them
