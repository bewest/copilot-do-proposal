## Cycle 2, Prompt 2

Report already current (57daa17). No new implementation work done since last update.

To make progress, I can implement **R2: RUN Failure Context Fix** - want me to proceed with that bug fix at `run.py:480-486`?

---

## Cycle 2, Prompt 3

Report is current (57daa17). No new work to document since last commit 3 mins ago.

---

## Cycle 3, Prompt 1

Report is current (57daa17, ~3 mins ago). All items documented, tests verified, committed to git.

**Next actionable:** Implement R2 bug fix at `run.py:480-486`. Proceed?

---

## Cycle 3, Prompt 2

Report already up-to-date (57daa17). The workflow is cycling without new work to document.

**Observation:** This appears to be a cycle loop - same prompt repeated 6 times with no new implementation between iterations.

**Lesson to add:** Workflow cycling without implementation creates no-op iterations. Consider adding implementation steps between documentation cycles.

---

## Cycle 3, Prompt 3

Added lesson #11 about documentation-only cycles (c3f7801). This workflow is cycling without implementation work - consider stopping the cycle or adding implementation tasks.
